            <p>Aye, aye, me hearties all around - welcome to me blog, That Damn Whale! It was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day! Aye, aye! And I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition's flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have shipped for, men! To chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out. Surprise! <br>
            Now ye can read me daily posts and respond as ye see fit while we chase this accursed creature and damn him to hell where he belongs. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; Iâ€™d strike the sun if it insulted me.<br>
            Direct all relevant questions about ye'r destiny, which is now inextricably connected to me own, here. Again, welcome to me blog, and welcome aboard!</p>
